# ðŸ“¦ | What is WebRig?
**WebRig** is a web-based rigging editor designed to facilitate the modification of humanoid 3D models without requiring prior knowledge of complex 3D editing software. This tool allows users to manipulate rigged humanoid models through an intuitive interface based on sliders, with each slider corresponding to a specific bone in the rig structure. Users can easily adjust the scale of each bone along the X, Y, and Z axes, enabling precise and efficient customization. The platform simplifies the rig editing process, making it accessible even to those without technical expertise in 3D modeling.
